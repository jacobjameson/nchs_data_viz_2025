        <h1>Gender, Depression, and Suicide in America</h1>
        <p class="byline">By Jacob Jameson and Madison Coots — February 1, 2025</p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            While women report higher rates of depression and are more likely to seek mental health care, men die by suicide at significantly higher rates — particularly in states with permissive gun laws.

            <h2>The Depression Gender Gap</h2>
            <p>
                Depression affects Americans differently across gender lines. A nine‑item depression screening questionnaire, called the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‑9), was administered to determine the frequency of depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

            <br>
            <p>
                        Among 2021-2023 NHANES adult survey respondents, <span class="female-text">women</span> were more than two times as likely as <span class="male-text">men</span> to have PHQ-9 scores indicating severe depression.

            <h2>Seeking Help: The Treatment Gap</h2>
            <p>
                The disparity in depression rates is matched by a significant gap in mental health care utilization. Research shows that men seek care less frequently, not only for mental health services but for primary care as well.

            <h2>The Deadly Paradox: Suicide Rates</h2>
            <p>
                Despite lower reported depression rates and less frequent mental health treatment, men die by suicide at substantially higher rates than women. This disparity is particularly pronounced in firearm-related suicides, where males commit suicide at rates up to 8.2 times higher than females among young adults.

                                <p>Firearm deaths have increased sharply across all ages since 2015 and recently overtook accidents as the most common cause of death among U.S. children and adolescents.</p>

            <h2>The Role of Gun Laws</h2>
            <p>
                State-level firearm policies show a striking correlation with suicide rates, particularly among men. In states with more permissive gun laws, male suicide rates are significantly higher — with the disparity most pronounced among teenagers and young adults.

                    Males aged 15-19 in states with permissive firearm policies are twice as likely to die by firearm suicide compared to those in states with stricter regulations.

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>
                These findings suggest a critical need for targeted interventions. While women report higher rates of depression and more readily seek treatment, men face unique challenges that may be masked by lower diagnosis rates. The data particularly highlights the need for culturally tailored outreach efforts to engage boys and men in preventive healthcare, alongside policy measures to address firearm access in vulnerable populations.
